Algorithms for Computational Biology
Focus on sequence alignment (global and local, starting with Needleman-Wunsch)
Future improvements include:
  1. Using a predefined subsitution matrix (i.e. BLOSUM90)
  2. Generalizing algorithms to protein sequences
  3. Extending to proteins
  4. Fit EVD to random simulated alignments
